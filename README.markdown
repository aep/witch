Installation
=======================

install qt4 (yeah yeah...)

qmake && ./install.sh

or do install.sh yourself if you don't have witch installed yet

You need to be uid=1000 or change the source code;

Security Philosophy
=========================

Witch does intend to protect multi user setups from evil users,
Instead it intends to protect single user machines from evil software.
Especcially in corporate environments where you have to execute shell and perl scripts full of "sudo".

Usage
==========================

I'll not document much details for now as they'll probably change.
For basic usage, just use it like you would run "sudo".
